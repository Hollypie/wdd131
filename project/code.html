        <h2>My Color Coding System</h2>
        <div class="color">
            <p class="colorCode">I have had enough questions about my color code system that I do in my scriptures that I decided it made sense to include it on this website. This picture is a quick snapshot of a legend I drew in the front of my scriptures to remind me of the system. Hopefully I'll find time to replace this picture with a better one in the future.  This system really isn't one I made up on my own, I learned it from another returned missionary in my ward just before my mission.  So you don't have to underline and mark everything, I create a little box around every verse number and choose an appropriate color to fill it in. I used to do this with color pencil and now I use bible highlight markers, they are so much faster. So this is basically how it works. As you study you try to pay attention to what is happening. If the Savoir or God is speaking, you mark it in red. If it's just narrative, like telling a story, mark it in blue. If it's wise words of a prophet or a prophet speaking words to remember, mark it in green. If it's a parable, mark it in yellow. If it's spiritual gifts like dreams or visions, mark them in orange. If it's giving geneaology or family lineage info, mark in purple. If it's praise to God or thanks, mark in pink. If it's Satan speaking, mark in grey. If it's telling you where something is happening like geography, mark in brown.  I've discovered that I pay attention more to my reading when I have to pay attention to each verse and make a decision on white color to mark it as. You will find that often there are multiple colors appropriate to a single verse. Like when the Savior is telling a parable. I often will use both. I mark the verse box red to indicate that Jesus is speaking but underline the verse in yellow to show it's a parable. Over time I've learned to not get to worked up if I make mistakes in my color code marking. I often do. It's not worth worrying about too much so long as you are learning the scriptures, it's all good. I find it gratifying to look back in my scriptures and see where I've studied.  I have a goal of color coding the whole thing cover to cover. I don't know if I ever will accomplish that but I enjoy trying. Something I've noticed about my method. You will discover that the three colors you use the most will be blue green and red. Green and blue are my favorite colors so I enjoy using them a lot. You could change the colors you choose to different things. I like using red for the words of the Savior because it mimics red letter bibles. Red letter bibles are bibles where all the words of the Savior or God are printed in red ink. I've always like this feature and wished our LDS scriptures were printed this way. I hope this helps anyone interested in color coding scripture study.</p>
